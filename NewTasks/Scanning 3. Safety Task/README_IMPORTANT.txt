Note:


Win = 1
Lose = 0

Win/Lose numeric assignment is inverted from original study but was changed here to match the generalisation task so we can use Molina's generalisation scripts. For any scripts I coded with win/lose trials for the NSF task we need to make sure we've got correct assignment of win/lose.

Number of trials were cut in half from original study because of 7T

Aversive white noise is 3x longer than tone in NAASA Avoidance Task

No tone is played for wins

Stim kept same including outcome as lightening bolt
